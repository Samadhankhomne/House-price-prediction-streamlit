# House-price-prediction-streamlit
A simple House Price Prediction application using Linear Regression.
  The project is built with a Streamlit front-end, allowing users to input property details (such as square footage) and receive a predicted house price based on the model. The machine learning model is trained using historical house price data and implemented using Python libraries such as scikit-learn, numpy, and pickle for model serialization.
